# AZ 104 Labs

This repository is a collection of labs and study notes I'm doing to study for the AZ104 exam.

The repo is structured with labs for each large area of knowledge the exam tests, so:

1. `identities&governance` - **Manage Azure identities and governance (20–25%)**
2. `storage` - **Implement and manage storage (15–20%)**
3. `compute` - **Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20–25%)**
4. `virtual-networking` - **Implement and manage virtual networking (15–20%)**
5. `monitoring` - **Monitor and maintain Azure resources (10–15%)**
