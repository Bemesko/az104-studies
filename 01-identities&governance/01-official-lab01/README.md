## What I Did
(All via the portal)
- Created a user manually
- Invited an external guest user
- Created a security group and assigned both users to it

## Next Steps
- How could I do the same 3 tasks using Azure Powershell and CLI?
- Is it possible to provision these using Bicep?
- Research how this is managed at scale (so people don't need to always go in and create these users manually)
- How to bulk create users and groups
- Differences between internal and external user accounts
